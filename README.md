# My Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my portfolio website, which showcases a bit about myself and the software development projects that I have worked on.

Please check it out at [https://julianlopez6850.github.io](https://julianlopez6850.github.io)!

The site was built using JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, & HTML.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
